# Instances for grid graphs

The folders _fc_, _sc_, and _pc_ contain the instances for _full coverage_, _subset _coverage_, and _penalty coverage_. The filenames are coded as follows: {problem: fc, s, p}_SIZE_{sparse/dense}_X.gg
The coding of the files is relatively simple: Every field has an individual row with the first column being the x-coordinate, the second coordinate being the y-coordinate, and the possible third coordinate being the 'is is subset' resp. the penalty.
