# Instances for geometric full coverage

The folder 'fc' contains the used instances for the experiments in the thesis. They are just uniformly selected random points of the unit square. The filename coding is 'geom_SIZE_X'. Every point has a row with the first column being the x-coordinate and the second column being the y-coordinate. There have only been experiments for full coverage without obstacles due to time constraints. The resolution/orientations is not part of the instances but have been selected uniformly as described in the thesis.
